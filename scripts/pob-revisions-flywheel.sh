# Local flywheel that keeps the People's Open Bible public revisions
# index honest. Walks both the YAML revision history (verses where an
# applied edit was committed) AND the local state/reviews/ tree (every
# verse-level review pass that ran, including "agree" verdicts where
# no edit was applied), then commits revisions.json + pushes if the
# numbers changed.
#
# Why local: state/ is gitignored — the 50k+ review records exist only
# on this Mac. GitHub Actions can only see committed YAML, which makes
# the public count look like ~9% of work done when it's actually
# ~100%. Running this from a launchd job (StartInterval=1800) means
# the public dashboard is at most 30 minutes behind reality without
# us bloating the repo with the raw review payloads.
