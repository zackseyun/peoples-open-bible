# Revision Methodology

This document describes how committed drafts are revised, who does the
revising, and what changes qualify as a revision vs. a redraft. It
complements [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) which covers the initial
AI-drafting pipeline.

## Why there's a revision stage

Every committed draft gets a second read. The drafting pipeline
(`tools/draft.py`) produces schema-valid YAML with full provenance,
and most verses ship as drafted — but a second-model review pass gives
every verse a second editorial eye before it's considered final.
Committing that pass as its own layer keeps the drafter's provenance
intact and makes every editorial change inspectable in git history.
See *What triggers a revision* below for the specific criteria.

## What triggers a revision

A verse is revised when a reviewer identifies one of these:

1. **Real English-grammar awkwardness** — stranded prepositions
   ("being testified to by"), literal-but-unnatural constructions
   ("in that by which you judge another"), double-noun stacks
   ("the one who justifies the one who"), or participial forms that
   don't parse cleanly in English ("becoming in the likeness of").
2. **Rhetorical-force loss** — when the Greek has a concessive,
   emphatic, or adversative force that a flat translation suppresses
   (Phil 2:6 `ὑπάρχων` → "though he was" rather than "existing").
3. **Wordplay that the draft flattens** — when the Greek pairs or
   echoes words the English could preserve more elegantly (Rom 3:26
   δίκαιον/δικαιοῦντα → "just and the justifier").
4. **Scholarly-preference shifts** — when a defensible but unusual
   rendering deviates from mainstream consensus for no textual reason
   (Rom 1:17 "from faith for faith" → "from faith to faith").
5. **Project-wide inconsistencies** — when per-verse drafter decisions
   produce corpus-level drift (see the Χριστός normalization below).

## What does NOT trigger a revision

- **Stylistic preference.** If the existing rendering is defensible and
  reads cleanly, it stays. The revision bar is "materially better,"
  not "my preference."
- **Theological re-interpretation.** Revisions don't change the
  meaning the translator intended — they polish the expression of that
  meaning. If a rendering is theologically contested, that's handled
  via `theological_decisions` and footnotes, not revision.
- **Lexicon-entry quibbles.** The drafter's lexicon call stands unless
  it's plainly wrong. BDAG entry disputes go through public issues on
  the GitHub repo, not silent revision.

## How a revision is committed

Each revision is a discrete git commit attributed to the revising
model. The commit message states:

- Which verses changed
- The specific rendering(s) replaced
- Why the change (category from the list above)
- What was preserved as an alternative (in footnote or
  `lexical_decisions.alternatives`)

The original AI draft's `ai_draft` metadata (model_id, prompt_sha256,
output_hash, timestamp) is preserved exactly — the drafter's
provenance stands. The revision is visible only in git log, not in
the verse YAML's top-level metadata. This keeps the chain of custody
clean: GPT-5.4 drafted this verse on such-and-such date; Claude Opus
polished it on such-and-such date; git shows both.

## Global-scope normalizations

Some corrections apply across every verse at once, not per-verse.
These are scripted and committed in a single pass.

### Χριστός → Messiah (accepted 2026-04-18)

After reviewing ~20 verses and noticing per-verse drift, the project
adopted a consistent rule for rendering the Greek title Χριστός:

| Greek form | POB rendering |
|---|---|
| `ὁ Χριστός` (the Christ) | the Messiah |
| `Χριστός` (bare, titular) | the Messiah |
| `Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς` (title first) | Messiah Jesus |
| `Ἰησοῦς Χριστός` (name first) | Jesus the Messiah |
| `Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ` (genitive) | Jesus the Messiah / of Jesus the Messiah |
| `ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ` | in Messiah Jesus |

**Rationale.** Χριστός literally means "anointed one" — it is the
Greek translation of Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ. In modern English, "Christ" has
drifted so far toward proper-name status that Paul's messianic claim
is skipped by most readers. DOCTRINE.md's principle — translate titles
rather than transliterate them — points toward consistent "Messiah."
Per-verse judgment between "Christ" and "Messiah" produces corpus-level
drift that can't be defended to a critic.

The one concession: standalone "Christ" in iconic English phrases
(e.g., Phil 1:21 "to live is Christ") is currently left as-is. A
follow-up pass may address these; for now, they're left for per-verse
judgment.

**Execution.** A mechanical script (`/tmp/normalize_messiah.py` at
time of writing; not committed) applied the compound-form rules to
every drafted verse in a single pass (68 substitutions across 68
verses). Footnotes, lexical_decisions, and theological_decisions were
left untouched so they continue to preserve "Christ" as the traditional
alternative where the drafter documented it.

### Χριστός → Messiah: liturgical carve-outs (accepted 2026-04-18)

After the mechanical pass, two classes of verse were reverted from
"Jesus the Messiah" back to "Jesus Christ" because the phrases function
as fixed liturgical forms in English-speaking Christian use, not as
fresh theological claims where the titular force of Χριστός is in
play:

1. **Pauline benediction formulas** — the closing "the grace of our
   Lord Jesus Christ [be with you]" appears as a fixed liturgical
   stamp at the end of most Pauline letters and is used verbatim in
   church benedictions. Reverted verses: Rom 16:20, Rom 16:24,
   2 Cor 13:13, Gal 6:18, Phil 4:23, 1 Thess 5:28, 2 Thess 3:18,
   Philemon 25. Also 2 Cor 8:9 ("the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   that though he was rich…"), which functions as a mid-letter fixed
   phrase rather than an argued titular claim.
2. **The Phil 2:11 confession** — "Jesus Christ is Lord" (`κύριος
   Ἰησοῦς Χριστός`) is the earliest recorded Christian creed and is
   recited verbatim in liturgy across traditions. Keeping "Messiah"
   here would sound like a scholarly gloss intruding on a confession.

All other occurrences of `Ἰησοῦς Χριστός` remain as "Jesus the
Messiah" per the normalization rule. The carve-outs are narrow and
named: benediction formulas and the Phil 2:11 confession. Any future
carve-out must be documented here with rationale.

**Execution.** A second mechanical script
(`/tmp/renormalize_liturgical.py` at time of writing; not committed)
applied three phrase-level reverts across the 10 verses above.
Footnotes and `lexical_decisions.alternatives` continue to preserve
"Messiah" as the alternative rendering.

### μετανοέω → "change of mind" / "change your thinking" (accepted 2026-04-19)

After a project-wide review of all 51 NT occurrences of μετανοέω
and μετάνοια, the project adopted a context-sensitive rule for
rendering the verb and its noun.

**The drift.** μετανοέω literally = "to change one's mind/thinking"
(μετά "change" + νοέω "think, perceive"). BDAG's gloss: "to change
one's mind or thinking." The traditional English rendering "repent"
preserved this in older usage but has drifted in modern English
toward "feel guilty about sin / apologize," which collapses the
cognitive force the Greek carries. Hearers of John the Baptist and
Jesus heard a call for fundamental worldview reorientation, not
primarily an emotional response.

**The rule.** Render μετανοέω / μετάνοια in three buckets, by
context:

1. **Worldview-reorientation contexts** (Jesus's and John the
   Baptist's kingdom proclamation, apostolic preaching to outsiders,
   theological summaries of the gospel call) → **"change your
   thinking" / "a change of mind"**. The cognitive force is dominant
   and "repent" obscures it.
2. **Specific-sin departure contexts** (Revelation's calls to the
   seven churches, Paul correcting specific moral failures, the
   adjective ἀμετανόητος "unrepentant") → **keep "repent" /
   "repentance"**. The Greek here pairs the verb with named sins
   (μετανοήσωσιν ἐκ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῆς, "repent of her works"), and
   English "repent" carries the right combined cognitive-and-
   behavioral force.
3. **Fixed liturgical formula** ("baptism of repentance," βάπτισμα
   μετανοίας — Mark 1:4, Luke 3:3, Acts 13:24, 19:4, and the
   parallel Matt 3:11) → **keep "baptism of repentance"**. The
   phrase is a 2,000-year-established English formula naming a
   ritual; replacing it would be jarring without illuminating the
   underlying Greek.

**Distinct verb: μεταμέλομαι.** The related verb μεταμέλομαι ("to
regret, change one's mind about something done") appears 6× in the
NT (Matt 21:29, 21:32, 27:3; 2 Cor 7:8 ×2; Heb 7:21) and is
distinct from μετανοέω. It carries the regret/remorse sense that
modern English "repent" has drifted toward. We render
μεταμέλομαι as "regret" or "change one's mind [about a prior
action]" — keeping it lexically separate from μετανοέω.

**Execution.** Two scripts (`/tmp/metanoia_revise.py`,
`/tmp/metanoia_revise2.py`; plus a lexical-decisions updater
`/tmp/metanoia_lex.py`; none committed) applied the per-verse
revisions across 30 verses. The remaining 21 verses (Revelation
specific-sin contexts, the baptism-of-repentance formula, the
ἀμετανόητος adjective in Rom 2:5, the interpersonal Luke 17:3-4,
the contested Heb 12:17 about Esau, and the μεταμέλομαι verses)
were deliberately kept as-is per the rule. An anchor footnote was
added to Matt 3:2 (the first NT occurrence) explaining the
project-level decision for reader transparency.

## Roles

| Model | Role |
|---|---|
| GPT-5.4 | Primary drafter. Produces first-pass verse YAMLs via `tools/draft.py`. Most verses ship as drafted. |
| Claude Opus 4.7 | Revision reviewer. Reads drafts, identifies revision-worthy issues per the criteria above, commits targeted polish. Does not redraft from scratch. |

## Community suggestions and public credit

Readers can suggest a revision from the public Bible reader after
signing in with a Cartha account. The suggestion is treated as an
input to the same revision process as model findings: it is checked
against the source text, compared with the existing rendering, and
resolved by the best available combination of human judgment and
AI-assisted source reasoning.

If a suggestion is approved, the public `revisions:` entry on that
verse may include a `credit` block:

```yaml
credit:
  source: community
  display_name: "Contributor Name"
  issue_url: "https://github.com/zackseyun/peoples-open-bible/issues/..."
```

That credit is intended to be durable. Once the approved revision is
committed, the contributor's public credit travels with the verse's
revision history and is surfaced by downstream public revision pages.
Private account details should not be published unless the contributor
explicitly chose that public credit string.

Public counters should keep this distinction clear: the complete
revision index still reports every accepted applied edit from the
machine-assisted and maintainer workflows, but the reader-facing
"approved human-proposed revisions" metric counts only approved
suggestions that carry public human/community credit.

## What revisions are NOT

- A redraft. Revisions take the drafter's rendering as the starting
  point and make targeted improvements. They don't ignore the draft
  and produce an alternative.
- Silent. Every revision is a git commit with rationale. Critics can
  read the commit log to see exactly what changed and why.

## Sentinels in adjudicator output (READ BEFORE APPLYING ANY REVISION)

Adjudicator agents (`claude-opus-4-7-doctrine-aware`,
`gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, etc.) sometimes emit a finding whose `to:`
field is not a literal replacement string but a *command* describing
the structural edit they want applied. These look like ALL-CAPS
imperatives (e.g. `DELETE FOOTNOTE`, `REMOVE MARKER`, `DROP ENTRY`).

**Never write the sentinel string into a YAML field.** A sentinel is
an instruction *to the human or agent applying the finding*, not the
new value. Writing it verbatim ships the literal word "DELETE" to the
CDN, where readers see it in their Bible app. (This actually happened
on Jubilees 26:25 in the 2026-04-28 doctrine-aware pass — the heal is
documented in `translation/extra_canonical/jubilees/026/025.yaml`.)

When `to:` is a sentinel, do the structural edit, not a string
replacement:

| Sentinel | Correct action |
|---|---|
| `DELETE FOOTNOTE` | Remove the entry from `translation.footnotes[]` whose `marker` matches, AND strip the corresponding `[marker]` anchor from `translation.text`. |
| `REMOVE MARKER` | Strip the `[marker]` from `translation.text` only; keep the footnote entry. |
| `DROP ENTRY` (in `lexical_decisions`) | Remove that list element. Don't replace it. |

If you encounter an unfamiliar ALL-CAPS imperative in `to:`, treat it
as a sentinel and stop. Don't guess the structural edit — escalate to
the human maintainer. A literal sentinel that has already leaked into
a YAML field is a regression, not a translation choice; heal it by
restoring the pre-sentinel state and re-evaluating the original
finding from scratch.

**Self-check before applying a revision pass:**

```bash
git grep -nE '^\s+text:\s+(DELETE|REMOVE|DROP|TODO|FIXME)\b' translation/
```

Should return zero hits. If it returns anything, a sentinel has been
written to a real field — fix it before the next CDN publish.
