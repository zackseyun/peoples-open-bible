"""Emit ``status.json`` — the public trust-layer dashboard data.

Walks ``translation/`` to count chapters and verses drafted per book,
pulls recent ``revise:`` / ``polish:`` commits from git log, and pins
the result to the current HEAD SHA. The output is committed at the
repo root so the People's Open Bible website can fetch it from
``raw.githubusercontent.com/.../main/status.json`` with no backend.

This is intentionally fast and cache-free: no YAML parsing, no schema
validation. Every signal is derived from directory structure + git log
so the script stays under ~1s on a cold run. Deeper per-verse signals
(footnote counts, cross-check agreement) are deferred until we have a
reason for them and a way to update them on a cadence.

Run from the repo root::

    python3 tools/build_status.py
    git add status.json && git commit -m "status: regenerate snapshot"
