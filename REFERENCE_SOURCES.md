# Reference sources — operational policy for translation

This document defines, operationally and legally, how copyrighted and
restricted-license scholarly sources may be used during translation
of the People's Open Bible. It is a companion to
[DEUTEROCANONICAL.md](DEUTEROCANONICAL.md) (scope/strategy) and
[METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) (pipeline).

The core claim: **consultation is not reproduction.** Scholars and
translators have always read the leading critical editions, let those
editions inform their judgment, and then produced their own fresh
work. That is what every serious modern translation does. This
document translates that long-standing practice into concrete rules
for our AI-assisted pipeline.

## Position assessment — where we stand per book

Reassessed **2026-09-04**. The former “optimal,” “near-optimal,” “definitive,”
and “sole witness” labels are withdrawn. They confused an available translation
input with a demonstrated best critical text. The former numerical prediction
of how little Tobit would differ from a Qumran-first translation was untested.
This correction does not change the consultation/reproduction policy below.

| Book / group | Available working route | Required comparison before a quality claim |
|---|---|---|
| **Sirach** | Hebrew witness/composite resources and Greek control | Keep each Hebrew manuscript separate; map actual survival and compare Greek/Syriac. A composite is not an independent manuscript |
| **Tobit** | Greek long-form control plus Hebrew/Aramaic witness research | Compare Greek recensions, 4Q196–200 where extant, and relevant versions. A modern or late Hebrew back-translation cannot replace direct Aramaic evidence |
| **1 Esdras** | Greek control and Hebrew parallel mapping | Assess Greek variants and literary relationships; Hebrew parallels are not automatically the lost source of every Greek sentence |
| **Wisdom; 2–4 Maccabees** | Greek working texts | Compare manuscript and critical-edition evidence; Greek composition does not make Swete definitive |
| **Judith; Baruch; Letter of Jeremiah; 1 Maccabees** | Greek working texts and versional controls | Establish each book's textual history and relevant language hypotheses without treating Swete as its only surviving witness |
| **Esther additions** | Greek working texts | Identify the textual form and compare relevant Greek traditions; distinguish attested Greek from hypotheses about prior composition |
| **Daniel additions** | Greek working texts | Keep Old Greek and Theodotion-associated forms distinct and assess passage-specific variants and source-language questions |

The [IOSCS edition guide](https://septuaginta.uni-goettingen.de/ioscs/editions/)
distinguishes Swete's edition from broader critical work. The IAA also records
[7Q2, a Greek Letter of Jeremiah manuscript](https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/7Q2-1?locale=en_US):
it is plainly not the same thing as a modern Swete volume. See the
[OT/NT coverage audit](docs/BIBLICAL_SOURCE_COVERAGE_AUDIT_2026-09-04.md)
for the catalogue-backed comparison plan. None of these rows certifies a
completed critical collation or changes the chosen canonical text.

**Operational note.** `ADE` and `ADA` are now best thought of as
aggregate source-stream labels. The active translation units are:

- `ESG` for the Esther additions (A–F)
- `PAZ`, `SUS`, and `BEL` for the Daniel additions

This keeps the source-preparation history auditable while giving Phase 9
clean reader-facing drafting targets.

**Net assessment — corrected 2026-09-05:** Available working texts do not
establish an optimal critical source. The book-specific comparisons above
remain necessary; consultation does not recover missing original-language
material or settle source rights. This replaces an obsolete paragraph that
contradicted the September 4 reassessment. The
[restoration research log](docs/TEXTUAL_RESTORATION_RESEARCH_LOG.md) records
the correction and the evidence-linked program history.

## The three zones

Every scholarly source sits in one of three zones with respect to our
pipeline. The zones are defined by how the source influences the
output, not by whether anyone looks at it.

### Zone 1 — Vendored (safe as both reference and Vorlage)

Clean-licensed sources that we can commit into the repository and use
as primary input for translation. Output is free to derive from these.

| Source | License | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Our Swete OCR | CC-BY 4.0 (ours) / source PD | `sources/lxx/swete/final_corpus_adjudicated/` |
| Sefaria Ben Sira (Kahana) | CC0 | `sources/lxx/hebrew_parallels/sefaria_ben_sira.json` |
| Sefaria Tobit (Neubauer 1878) | Public Domain | `sources/lxx/hebrew_parallels/sefaria_tobit.json` |
| WLC (Westminster Leningrad Codex) | Public Domain | `sources/ot/wlc/` |
| Schechter 1899 *Wisdom of Ben Sira* | Public Domain | `sources/hebrew_sirach/schechter_1899/` |
| First1KGreek TEI-XML (validation only) | CC-BY-SA 4.0 | not in repo — consulted |

Zone 1 content MAY appear in the prompt context used to generate the
English translation and MAY influence specific word choices.

### Zone 2 — Consulted reference (aware of, not derived from)

Copyrighted or restricted-license scholarly sources that inform our
judgment without appearing in the output. Examples:

- **Yadin 1965, *The Ben Sira Scroll from Masada* (editio princeps)** — Edition of the Masada Hebrew witness, preserving portions within Sir 39:27–44:17. When local notes are available, `tools/yadin_masada.py::lookup(chapter, verse)` supplies edition reference material for requests within this outer span. Page-index associations do not establish that a requested verse or reading survives. Sirach 4, 49 and 51 are not Masada coverage; the previously stated 413-verse figure is not verified manuscript attestation. Local notes were unavailable at the 2026-10-04 check. Nothing from this consulted edition is vendored; the Zone 2 policy remains in force.
- **Fitzmyer, *Discoveries in the Judaean Desert* Vol. XIX (Qumran Tobit)** — reconstructed Aramaic of 4Q196-200
- **Beentjes 1997, *The Book of Ben Sira in Hebrew*** — critical edition of all recovered Hebrew Sirach
- **Skehan & Di Lella 1987, Anchor Bible 39** — English Sirach with critical apparatus
- **Göttingen LXX critical editions** (Hanhart and others)
- **Rahlfs-Hanhart 2006 Stuttgart revised LXX** — reading text
- **Leon Levy DSS Digital Library images** — Qumran photographs

Rules for Zone 2:

1. **Access is legitimate.** A translator (human or AI) may read
   these works, the same way any paid scholarly translator does.
2. **The output must not track the source's creative expression.**
   Specifically: where the Zone 2 source supplies a *reconstruction*
   of missing or damaged text (filled-in letters, chosen readings
   among variants, editorial ordering), our English rendering must
   not word-for-word follow that reconstruction. It may be *informed*
   by it — confirming a reading the LXX also attests, or flagging a
   suggested divergence — but the primary anchor of our English is
   a Zone 1 source.
3. **Fact-level citation is allowed.** Footnotes of the form "Qumran
   4Q196 supports the Long Recension reading here" cite a *fact*
   about what the manuscript attests, not the scholar's creative
   expression. *Feist v. Rural Telephone Service* (1991) establishes
   facts are not copyrightable.
4. **Nothing from Zone 2 is committed to the repository.** Vendoring
   would propagate the source's license to every downstream consumer
   of POB. Consultation is private to the translator's workspace.

### Zone 3 — Forbidden during drafting

A small set of sources that we actively avoid consulting:

- **Translations under commercial copyright** (including NKJV, NIV, NLT, and
  ESV). We do not expose these to the drafter — our English must not track their
  word choices, and the cleanest drafting boundary is not to include them in an
  LLM prompt.
- **Sources where the license explicitly prohibits even internal use**
  (none currently).

An explicitly licensed commercial translation may be used **after drafting** in
an isolated evaluation process. `tools/build_translation_divergence.py` accepts
a private, gitignored NKJV/NIV/NLT bundle and emits only numeric similarity
scores. It never emits the licensed wording, never feeds that wording back into
the drafting prompt, and never lets a commercial translation determine the
review-priority score. This preserves the clean-room drafting boundary while
allowing licensed comparative research.

## How this flows into the translation prompt

The translator agent (AI drafter + human/AI reviser) receives a
structured context per verse. The context includes all Zone 1 and
Zone 2 sources available for that verse, with each labeled by zone.

### Context block shape

```yaml
verse_ref: "SIR 1:1"
zone_1_primary:
  greek:
    source: "Swete LXX (our OCR, CC-BY 4.0)"
    text: "Πᾶσα σοφία παρὰ Κυρίου καὶ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐστιν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα."
  hebrew:  # present only for SIR, TOB, and 1ES with MT parallel
    source: "Sefaria Ben Sira / Kahana (CC0)"
    kind: "direct_hebrew"
    text: "כָּל חָכְמָה מֵיהֹוָה, וִעמּוֹ הִיא לְעוֹלָמִים."
    note: "Kahana composite edition of Cairo Geniza Hebrew. This is a working source, not one physical manuscript or an adjudicated earliest Hebrew text."
zone_1_secondary:
  - "First1KGreek (CC-BY-SA): <Greek variant, if any>"
  - "Rahlfs-Hanhart (NC, consultation only): <Greek reading>"
  - "Swete-Amicarelli (GPL, consultation only): <Greek reading>"
zone_2_consult:  # reference only -- do not reproduce or track word-for-word
  - name: "Beentjes 1997"
    book_scope: "SIR"
    guidance: "Critical edition of Hebrew Sirach MSS A-F. Consult if Kahana reading seems wrong or if this verse is in a Kahana gap."
  - name: "Skehan & Di Lella 1987 (Anchor Bible 39)"
    book_scope: "SIR"
    guidance: "English Sirach with critical apparatus. Consult for argued interpretive cruxes -- do NOT track their English phrasing."
instructions_to_translator:
  primacy: >
    For Sirach verses with a direct_hebrew witness, translate from
    the Hebrew (Zone 1 primary hebrew). Use the Greek as a consistency
    check and for verses where the Hebrew is lost/damaged. Where Zone
    2 scholarship suggests a different reading from our Zone 1 Hebrew,
    document the disagreement in the apparatus but keep the output
    anchored in Zone 1.
  forbidden: >
    Do not reproduce word-for-word translations from Zone 2. Footnote
    their conclusions as facts where relevant.
```

For Tobit specifically, the Zone 2 block carries Fitzmyer's DJD XIX
reconstruction of 4Q196-200 where the verse falls in the ~20%
overlap. The translator knows the reconstruction exists, can factor
in its textual-critical verdict, and can note disagreements in
footnotes — but the English output anchors in the LXX Long Recension
(Zone 1 Greek) + Neubauer (Zone 1 Hebrew back-translation).

### Implementation

`tools/hebrew_parallels.py` already returns Zone 1 Hebrew/MT data per
verse. It is extended to also list the Zone 2 sources applicable to
each book, so a translation-phase prompt builder can assemble the
context block mechanically without per-book special-casing.

The translator-prompt builder itself (Phase 8-C deuterocanon drafting work, not yet written)
will:

1. Load the Greek verse from `sources/lxx/swete/final_corpus_adjudicated/`,
   with translation-ready overrides from `sources/lxx/swete/final_corpus_normalized/`
   when a known numbering contamination has been formally normalized
2. Call `hebrew_parallels.lookup(book, ch, vs)` for Zone 1 Hebrew/MT
3. Pull Zone 1 secondary reference readings where available
4. Inject the Zone 2 "consult" block from the book's Zone 2 registry
5. Wrap with the doctrine and style instructions from DOCTRINE.md
6. Call the translator model (GPT-5.4) with the assembled prompt

## Derivative-work exposure — concrete test

Before shipping any verse, the reviser asks three questions:

1. **Anchor:** is the English primarily supported by a Zone 1 source?
2. **Zone 2 independence:** if the Zone 2 reading were redacted from
   the translator's context, would the English still be defensible
   from Zone 1 alone? (This is the "consulted, not derived" test.)
3. **Fact vs. expression:** is anything we *reproduce* from Zone 2
   a fact (manuscript reading, dating, scholarly conclusion) rather
   than creative expression (reconstructed wording, editorial
   phrasing)?

A verse passes if all three answer "yes." A verse that fails gets
re-drafted from Zone 1 alone and re-reviewed.

## Rationale — why this is the right path

**For accuracy.** A translator who consults every leading scholarly
edition produces better work than one who works from a single source.
This is how every serious modern translation is produced (NRSV,
NABRE, Orthodox Study Bible). We match that standard.

**For license cleanliness.** CC-BY 4.0 on our output requires that
output be free to redistribute. Derivative works of Zone 2 sources
are not free to redistribute. The three-zone discipline keeps our
output demonstrably downstream of only Zone 1, while still benefiting
from Zone 2 through consultation.

**For honesty with readers.** Each verse's provenance can be reported
in the per-verse YAML with full disclosure: which Zone 1 sources
anchored the translation, which Zone 2 sources informed it, and
whether any scholarly disagreement is footnoted. Readers can audit
exactly what shaped each rendering.

**For scalability.** The pipeline is mechanical. Zone assignments are
declared once per source; translator prompts assemble automatically;
derivative-work checks are explicit. No ad-hoc judgment per verse.

## Confidence rubric for corpus adjudication

Every verse in the scan-adjudicated corpus carries a confidence
level. The rubric below is applied strictly by the adjudicator
(AI or human):

**HIGH** — reading can be defended rigorously:
- Every character of the verse is clearly readable in the scan,
  including all diacritics (accents, breathings, iota subscripts)
- The reading output exactly matches what is printed, or matches
  one of the independent transcription candidates exactly
- No visible smudging, faded ink, torn paper, or ambiguous
  letterforms in the verse area

**MEDIUM** — reading is defensible but has known ambiguity:
- Verse is substantively readable, but specific characters are
  ambiguous (e.g. ε vs ω on a worn letter, acute vs circumflex,
  α vs δ)
- A best-guess call has been made but the scan permits an
  alternative reading a specialist might prefer
- Verse boundary or punctuation placement is genuinely ambiguous

**LOW** — reading cannot be visually verified:
- Verse is not legibly visible on the provided scan page
- Severe damage, ink bleed, or missing text
- Reading relies on candidates alone, without visual verification

Calibration principle: **it is better to mark MEDIUM and be correct
about uncertainty than to mark HIGH and be overconfident.** Medium
is a disclosure layer, not a defect. A published verse with
`source_confidence: medium` is a trust signal to readers that the
source-text reading has a specific, documented uncertainty the
translator and reviewer were aware of.
