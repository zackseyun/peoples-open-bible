# Jubilees (Mashafa Kufale) source materials

Public-domain source editions for the People's Open Bible's working
Jubilees translation. **Scope and strategy: [`../../JUBILEES.md`](../../JUBILEES.md).**

Current qualification (2026-10-05): source and reader drafts exist, but
manuscript-specific collation is incomplete. The
[1:27 case](../../docs/JUBILEES_1_27_SOURCE_COMPARISON_2026-10-05.md)
records the actual consulted context, source/English retention, recording-role
hold and missing primary apparatus. The historical chapter-range table below
is not verified coverage
of every manuscript; related compositions must not be counted as copies of
the same work. OCR agreement is not a character-accuracy measurement.

## Textual situation

Jubilees was composed in Hebrew c. 160-150 BC as a retelling of
Genesis 1 through Exodus 14 organized around the 49-year "jubilee"
cycle. Hebrew witnesses survive at Qumran, including 4Q216 (DJD XIII,
1994 — Zone 2). The former blanket 4Q216–228 equivalence was inaccurate;
for example, 4Q225 is discussed as Pseudo-Jubilees in the linked case.
A Greek translation once
existed (cited by Syncellus and Byzantine chronographers) but is
lost. A Latin translation of roughly half the book (chs 13-49)
survives in a single 5th/6th-century palimpsest and was critically
edited by Rönsch in 1874. The only complete witness is the **Ethiopic
(Ge'ez)** translation, preserved in the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition
and first critically edited by Charles 1895.

## Witness coverage by chapter range

| Chapters | Ge'ez (Charles 1895 OCR, CC-BY 4.0 our work) | Latin (Rönsch 1874) | Qumran Hebrew (Zone 2, via VanderKam-Milik) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1–12 | ✓ | — | 4Q216-217 partial |
| 13–49 | ✓ | **✓ (Rönsch)** | 4Q219-228 scattered |
| 50 | ✓ | ✓ | — |

Chapters 13-49 have the strongest multi-witness coverage because
the Latin fragments align with much of the Qumran Hebrew material.

## Zone 2 consult (scholarly, not reproduced)

Per [`../../REFERENCE_SOURCES.md`](../../REFERENCE_SOURCES.md):

- **VanderKam & Milik, *DJD XIII: Qumran Cave 4 VIII: Parabiblical Texts Part 1*** (1994) — Hebrew Jubilees fragments 4Q216-228
- **VanderKam, *The Book of Jubilees*** (CSCO 510-511, 1989) — modern critical Ethiopic edition + English translation
- **Segal, *The Book of Jubilees: Rewritten Bible, Redaction, Ideology and Theology*** (Brill, 2007)
- **Wintermute, "Jubilees" in OTP vol. 2 (Charlesworth, ed.)** (1985)

Consulted during translation; never reproduced.

## OCR pipeline

Same Ge'ez pipeline as Enoch, now pinned to **Gemini 3.1 Pro
preview** in plaintext mode with low thinking budget. Validated on
Jubilees ch 1 (2026-04-22) with byte-identical 3-run consistency and
correct title/prologue/verse structure. Azure GPT-5 (our LXX backend)
fails on Ge'ez; Gemini 2.5 Flash hallucinates content.

No Beta maṣāḥǝft-style digital Ge'ez oracle exists for Jubilees
specifically, so our OCR cross-check relies on the two PD scholarly
editions (Charles 1895 + Dillmann-Rönsch 1874) as mutual checks.

## Status

**2026-04-22: transcription in progress.** PDFs vendored, OCR
benchmark closed, verse parser + translator prompt builder implemented.
Remaining intermediate steps are full-body OCR regeneration, full
chapter page-map completion, and then corpus assembly.
