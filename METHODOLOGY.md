# Methodology

The People's Open Bible is produced by a pipeline that treats every verse
as auditable. Each rendering is committed alongside the source text
behind it, the draft/revision metadata that shaped it, and any later
edit with its rationale. This document is a reproducibility map: it
shows the sources, review layers, and public artifacts someone would
need in order to inspect or reproduce the results without replaying
our internal work log step by step.

## Pipeline overview

```

Model diversity is a deliberate quality layer: any revision pass run
by a different model from the first drafter helps fight same-model
bias. Cross-pollinating model families gives the strongest reasoning
and best outcome; spot fixes are an additional targeted pass when a
verse needs more scrutiny.

Per-verse stages 1–4 are described below. For revision policy and what
triggers a post-publication change, see
[REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md](REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md). For doctrinal and
lexical defaults, see [DOCTRINE.md](DOCTRINE.md) and
[PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md). For the source-licensing inventory,
see [REFERENCE_SOURCES.md](REFERENCE_SOURCES.md).

## Reproducible workflow at a glance

The translation came together across four overlapping corpora. The
details below are not meant as a run-by-run history; they name the
source families, repeatable checks, and durable outputs that matter
for reproducing or auditing the work.

### Chapter 1 — Canonical corpus

| Reproducible step | Scope | What to inspect or repeat |
|---|---|---|
| Source selection | New Testament + Hebrew Bible | Use the canonical source bundles named in Stage 1: SBLGNT for the Greek New Testament, WLC/UHB for the Hebrew Bible, and the project-level source/licensing inventory in [REFERENCE_SOURCES.md](REFERENCE_SOURCES.md). |
| Draft generation | Every canonical verse | Re-run the same per-verse draft pattern: source text + doctrine/philosophy anchors + versioned prompt/model metadata. The output is stored as verse YAML, not as an opaque compiled file. |
| Review and revision | Same canonical corpus | Run the source-facing review pass and inspect each verse's `revisions` block to see whether the reviewer changed the draft, accepted it unchanged, or preserved an alternate reading. |

The internal pilot and milestone order are preserved in commit history
and older operational docs, but they are not the important thing to
reproduce. For a reader or outside reviewer, the repeatable unit is
the verse record: source evidence, draft metadata, review result, and
published artifact.

### Chapter 2 — Deuterocanon

The deuterocanon broke the canonical pipeline because no
openly-licensed scan-grounded source corpus existed. Source
preparation became its own project before drafting could even start.

| Stage | Corpus | What it solved |
|---|---|---|
| Source rescue | Deuterocanonical OT (Swete LXX 12 books, 6,337 verses) | Source-text rescue, not drafting. Established the scan-grounded adjudication loop ([docs/PHASE8_CORPUS_QUALITY_RESCUE.md](docs/PHASE8_CORPUS_QUALITY_RESCUE.md)). Ended with 98.9% high-confidence verses (3,425/3,464 adjudicated). |
| Drafting | Apocrypha drafting — all 18 deuterocanonical books, 6,047 verses, plus Psalms of Solomon and Prayer of Manasseh | Drafting after the source rescue. Introduced the Gemini-reviewer pass for author-intent corrections (216 auto-applied; 451 Azure tier-3 adjudications). Prayer of Manasseh is a diplomatic reconstruction of Codex Alexandrinus from Charles 1913 APOT vol 1 pp. 636–640. |

### Chapter 3 — Extra-canonical witnesses

Extra-canonical material is translated for transparency about the
Jewish/early-Christian textual world — not claimed as scripture, but
surfaced so readers can see what existed alongside the canonical
books. Each language family forced a different OCR + parser stack.

| Corpus | Status |
|---|---|
| 2 Esdras — Latin Bensly 1895 + 6 daughter witnesses (Syriac, Ethiopic, Arabic, Armenian, Georgian) | Drafted. Established the multi-witness pipeline pattern for non-Greek primary sources. |
| Psalms of Solomon (Swete vol 3, 18 chapters, 330 verses) | Drafted. Proved the Swete pipeline extends to extra-canonical Greek. |
| Greek Apostolic Fathers — Didache, 1 Clement, Shepherd of Hermas | Drafted. Established the shared Greek extra-canonical pipeline. |
| 1 Enoch — Charles 1906 (critical, 23 MSS) + Dillmann 1851 | Drafted end-to-end in Ge'ez → English at corpus scale. |
| Jubilees — Charles 1895 (critical, 4 MSS) | Drafted end-to-end in Ge'ez → English at corpus scale. Output under `translation/extra_canonical/jubilees/`. |
| Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs (Greek, Sinker 1879) | Drafted across all 12 testaments. Greek normalization complete. |
| Nag Hammadi (Coptic) — Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Truth, Thunder Perfect Mind | OCR via Gemini 3.1 Pro (Coptic-aware). Gospel of Thomas redrafted using cross-family Coptic comparison (38/38 sayings). |

### Chapter 4 — Standing review pipeline

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| Stacked-review pass | Each verse gets a per-book author-intent context pass with **Gemini 3.1 Pro**. Corrections auto-apply where evidence is strong; weaker findings escalate to a manually-adjudicated tier. The full negotiation history (`from`, `to`, rationale, reviewer model) is persisted in the verse YAML's `revisions` array. |
| Flywheel | A revisions flywheel runs every 30 minutes, regenerating `revisions.json` and pushing if any counts changed. As of the most recent snapshot, ~22,000 applied edits across ~18,700 verses, with ~60,000 review-pass verdicts logged across ~41,000 verses (including "agree" verdicts where no edit was applied). |

Public reader surfaces deliberately separate those numbers. The large
`total_revisions` value means all accepted applied edits, including
machine-assisted review-pass fixes. The small homepage badge uses
`approved_significant_revisions` (with `approved_proposed_revisions`
kept as a backwards-compatible alias): approved reader/maintainer
proposals plus major source-grounded review findings that were accepted
into the public text. It intentionally excludes routine Tier-1 cleanup,
grammar-only polish, and the much larger machine-assisted full-pass
total, so the badge represents revisions that materially changed
meaning, source fidelity, doctrine alignment, verse boundaries, or
restored broken/truncated text.

The standing review pipeline is the project's current center of
gravity. If you load a verse YAML at random today, the most likely
thing you'll see beyond the original draft is a revision block from
this pass.

## Stage 1 — Source text preparation

Source texts are vendored under `sources/` with their original
licenses and verifiable provenance. The headline sources:

- **SBLGNT** (CC-BY 4.0) — Michael W. Holmes, ed., *The Greek New
  Testament: SBL Edition*. Society of Biblical Literature, 2010.
- **Westminster Leningrad Codex** — transcription of the Leningrad
  Codex (1008 AD).
- **unfoldingWord Hebrew Bible** (CC-BY-SA 4.0) — morphologically
  tagged Hebrew OT.
- **Swete LXX** (public domain) — Henry Barclay Swete, ed., *The
  Old Testament in Greek According to the Septuagint*, 3 vols.
  (Cambridge University Press, 1909–1930). Vendored as our own OCR
  transcription under CC-BY 4.0 at `sources/lxx/swete/`.

For the deuterocanon and extra-canonical works, source preparation
is a substantial project of its own — the per-book table below.

### Stage 1A — Per-book source strategy

Different corpora demand different OCR engines and different witness
strategies. The choice is empirical, not aesthetic. The current
defaults reflect the 2026-04-22 OCR bake-off; earlier choices are
preserved in the phase docs for historical completeness.

| Corpus | Primary edition | OCR engine (current) | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| LXX deuterocanon (12 books) | Swete 1909, vols 1–3 | Azure GPT-5.4 vision | Strong polytonic Greek; clean output on Cambridge typography |
| Prayer of Manasseh | Charles 1913 APOT vol 1 pp. 636–640 | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Apparatus-and-footnote reconstruction; needed structured semantic understanding |
| Psalm 151 | Swete vol 2 p. 432 | Azure GPT-5.4 | Standard Swete path |
| 2 Esdras | Bensly 1895 (critical Latin) + Violet 1910 (6 daughter witnesses in parallel columns) | Azure GPT-5.4 vision | Columnar Latin + parallel witness placement |
| 1 Enoch | Charles 1906 (critical, 23 MSS) + Dillmann 1851 | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Selected by 2026-04-22 OCR bake-off (3.1 Pro 80% vs Azure 46%); replaced earlier "Gemini 2.5 Pro plaintext" pipeline |
| Jubilees | Charles 1895 (critical, 4 MSS) | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Same Ge'ez constraint as 1 Enoch |
| Didache | Hitchcock & Brown 1884 | Azure GPT-5.4 + Gemini 3.1 Pro reviewer | Polytonic Greek; Gemini spot-checks Azure's drafts |
| 1 Clement | Funk 1901 (critical with notes) | Azure GPT-5.4 | Polytonic + interleaved Latin handled cleanly |
| Shepherd of Hermas | Lightfoot 1891 | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Page layout defeated Azure; Gemini Pro succeeds |
| Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs | Sinker 1879 | Azure GPT-5.4 | Polytonic Greek; layout straightforward |
| Nag Hammadi (Thomas, Truth, Thunder) | NHC II,2 / NHC I,3 / NHC VI,2 facsimiles + Mattison/Zinner ecosystem | Gemini 3.1 Pro (Coptic-aware) | Coptic script; no Azure baseline |

Default, in one sentence: **Gemini 3.1 Pro for non-Greek and difficult
layouts; Azure GPT-5.4 for clean Cambridge polytonic Greek; the other
serves as second-pass reviewer.**

### Stage 1B — Three-tier scan-grounded adjudication

Every deuterocanonical verse is adjudicated against multiple
witnesses at full scan resolution before it is allowed to feed the
drafter:

1. **Tier 1 (4-source comparison at ≥3,000 px).** Our Swete
   transcription is compared against three independent witnesses:
   First1KGreek TEI, the Rahlfs-Hanhart digital edition (consulted as
   reference, see Zone-2 policy below), and Amicarelli/BibleBento.
   The verdict is **scan-grounded**: confidence is rated by visual
   legibility of the Cambridge page, not by witness agreement alone.
2. **Tier 2 (Gemini cross-check).** Verses that remain uncertain
   after Tier 1 are escalated to Gemini for a second opinion against
   the scan.
3. **Tier 3 (content-based page re-identification).** When running-
   head parsing has missed a page, the verse text itself is used to
   relocate the correct printed page and the rescue runs against the
   right scan.

The confidence rubric:

- **high** — printed form unambiguous; witnesses agree or disagree
  for explainable reasons; we trust this verse.
- **medium** — character-level ambiguity remains (ligature, breathing
  mark, faded ink); honest residual uncertainty.
- **low** — unverifiable from the available scans; deferred or held
  out of the drafter input.

The deuterocanon source rescue ended with 98.9% high (3,425/3,464
adjudicated), 1.1% medium, 0% low. The full rescue methodology —
including the failure taxonomy (wrong-page targeting, verse-number
drift, edition-specific numbering, true paleographic ambiguity) —
is documented in
[docs/PHASE8_CORPUS_QUALITY_RESCUE.md](docs/PHASE8_CORPUS_QUALITY_RESCUE.md).

The tooling: `tools/adjudicate_corpus.py`,
`tools/adjudicate_escalated.py`,
`tools/adjudicate_escalated_gemini.py`,
`tools/rescue_manual_pages.py`.

## Stage 2 — First draft

A primary LLM produces the draft using a prompt anchored in
[DOCTRINE.md](DOCTRINE.md). The draft includes:

- English rendering
- Lexical decisions (key words, chosen glosses, alternatives,
  lexicon entry consulted)
- Theological decisions (contested readings, alternatives preserved
  in footnotes)
- Source-text citations (edition + pages, archive.org-linkable
  where possible)

The drafter prompt loads, in addition to the verse, the relevant
doctrinal-anchor excerpt from DOCTRINE.md, the relevant philosophy
excerpt from [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md), and any per-book
apparatus or witness parallels recorded for that book.

Draft metadata recorded per verse:

- `model_id` — e.g., `gpt-5.4`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`,
  `claude-opus-4-7` (used for occasional spot fixes)
- `model_version` — knowledge cutoff + release tag
- `prompt_id` — versioned prompt identifier (e.g., `nt_draft_v1`)
- `prompt_sha256` — hash of the exact prompt used
- `temperature` — generation parameter
- `timestamp` — ISO 8601 UTC
- `output_hash` — sha256 of the model's raw output

The drafting script is `tools/draft.py`. Reproducibility is
enforced: given the same model, prompt hash, and source text,
re-running the script produces the same draft within model
non-determinism bounds, which are documented per draft.

## Stage 3 — Revision pass

What actually runs on every verse today is a **two-stage pipeline**:
a primary drafter, followed by an independent revision pass on a
different model family. The original design document called for
running three frontier models in parallel and scoring agreement on
edit distance and lexical-key overlap. We still use that comparison
selectively for high-uncertainty verses, but it is not the default
per-verse path. The honest description is:

1. **Primary drafter.** Most canonical books were drafted by GPT-5.4;
   Ge'ez and Coptic books were drafted with Gemini 3.1 Pro feeding
   off Gemini 3.1 Pro OCR transcripts; specific verses with content
   filtering issues were redrafted with Gemini 3.1 Pro as a fallback
   (97 Azure-blocked verses in 4 Maccabees and other martyrdom
   passages, processed 2026-04-23). Claude Opus 4.7 has been used
   for occasional spot fixes on individual verses needing targeted
   rework or another independent model-family pass.
2. **Revision pass.** Gemini 3.1 Pro reads each draft against
   the source text, identifies lexical
   disagreements, awkward English, and category-1 grammar issues,
   and adjudicates whether to apply a change or mark the verse
   `unchanged`. Every verdict is logged. Every applied edit is
   recorded in the verse YAML's `revisions` array with `from`, `to`,
   rationale, and `reviewer_model`.
3. **Tier-3 adjudicator.** Verses where the primary drafter and the
   revision pass disagree on something doctrinally salient are
   escalated to Azure GPT-5.4 for a third opinion. The deuterocanon
   drafting pass produced 451 such adjudications.
4. **Doctrine + grammar lint.** A regression layer catches cases
   where an automated revision silently violates a documented
   project policy (e.g., Χριστός being changed back to "Christ"
   against DOCTRINE.md). Reverts are visible in the same
   `revisions` array.

This is the project's strongest defense against hallucination. A
draft from one model family, read against the source by a different
model family, with a separate adjudicator on disagreements and a
mechanical lint on policy violations, produces a more trustworthy
verse than any single model run in isolation. Disagreements are not
a bug — they are the signal we want to surface.

For verses that the lint or adjudicator has flagged repeatedly, a
selective comparison-of-three-models run is invoked, scored on
edit-distance + lexical-key overlap. The scoring thresholds and
escalation rules live with the tooling rather than on this page;
see `tools/cross_check.py`. The revision-pass tooling lives in
`tools/gemini_bulk_revise.py` and
`tools/adjudicate_escalated_gemini.py`.

## Stage 4 — Publication

Drafted and revised verses are committed to the `main` branch.
Each commit message references the related source range and the
model that produced the draft. Earlier preview tags exist in the
git history as historical milestones; current state of the
translation is well beyond them.

Every verse in the repository is marked `status: draft`. The Cartha
Open Bible does not currently have a formal scholarly review
process; published drafts are the AI's output, with the full
rationale visible alongside each rendering. Revision happens after
publication, in the open, with full provenance preserved (see
[REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md](REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md)).

The website and mobile apps do **not** read this repo directly for
Bible text. They both pull a compiled JSON snapshot from the CDN at
`https://bible.cartha.com`, regenerated whenever new drafts or
revisions land on `main`.

### Per-verse provenance schema

Each verse YAML at `translation/<testament>/<book>/<chap>/<verse>.yaml`
records:

- `source.text` — the Greek/Hebrew/Ge'ez/Latin/Coptic string
- `source.edition` — named edition (e.g., `lxx-swete-1909`,
  `charles-1913-apot-vol1`, `charles-1895-ethiopic`)
- `source.pages` — archive.org-linkable page numbers
- `source.confidence` — high/medium/low (scan-grounded for
  deuterocanon)
- `adjudication` (if scan-grounded) — which witnesses agreed,
  which didn't, rescuer's verdict
- `translation.text` — the English rendering
- `lexical_decisions` — per-word gloss + rationale + alternatives
- `theological_decisions` — contested readings, alternatives,
  footnotes
- `ai_draft` — model_id, prompt_hash, output_hash, timestamp
- `revisions` — array of `{from, to, rationale, reviewer_model,
  timestamp}` entries; the original draft is preserved alongside
  every applied edit

Schema definition: `schema/verse.schema.json`.

A reader who wants to verify any verse can pull the Zone-1 source
edition from archive.org, find the cited pages, compare the printed
text against `source.text`, and inspect the `confidence` and
`adjudication` fields to see what was uncertain.

## Revision policy

Drafts are not the final word. Every phase is followed by a
revision pass that runs in three layers
([REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md](REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md),
[docs/REVISION_PROCESS.md](docs/REVISION_PROCESS.md)):

- **Layer 1 (during drafting).** `tools/consistency_lint.py` runs
  per commit, flagging same-lemma-different-gloss without rationale,
  contradictions of DOCTRINE.md defaults, missing source citations,
  and malformed YAML. Lint failures block merge to main.
- **Layer 2 (per-phase revision).** After a phase draft is complete,
  the corpus is revised in thematic batches. The Pauline runbook
  ([docs/PHASE1_REVISION_RUNBOOK.md](docs/PHASE1_REVISION_RUNBOOK.md))
  defines five batches: (1) Pauline core vocabulary (πίστις,
  δικαιοσύνη, σάρξ, νόμος, χάρις, κύριος, Χριστός), (2) Eucharistic
  and body-of-Christ passages, (3) OT citation handling, (4)
  readability sweep, (5) cross-reference verification.
- **Layer 3 (whole-Bible).** Once a full draft exists across both
  testaments, voice is unified across OT/NT and cross-phase
  inconsistencies are resolved.

What triggers a revision: real English grammar awkwardness;
rhetorical-force loss; wordplay the draft flattened; scholarly
preference drift without a textual reason; corpus-level
inconsistencies. What does **not** trigger a revision: stylistic
preference, theological re-interpretation absent textual evidence,
lexicon-entry quibbles. Full criteria in
[REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md](REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md).

Revision commits preserve the original `ai_draft` provenance — the
prior rendering is visible in git log, not deleted from the YAML.
Commit subjects start with `revise`, `polish`, `normalize`, `rename`,
or `consistency` so the public progress dashboard can filter them.

### Global normalizations

A small number of decisions apply at corpus scale, not per-verse.
These are documented in
[REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md](REVISION_METHODOLOGY.md) under
"Global-scope normalizations" and include:

- **Χριστός → Messiah** (decided 2026-04-18, applied to ~68 verses).
  "Christ" preserved as alternative in footnotes. **Liturgical
  carve-outs**: Pauline benediction formulas (Rom 16:20, 2 Cor
  13:13, Gal 6:18, Phil 4:23, 1 Thess 5:28, 2 Thess 3:18, Phlm 25,
  2 Cor 8:9) and the Phil 2:11 confession revert to "Christ"
  because they are fixed liturgical forms in the early church.
- **μετανοέω context-sensitive rendering** (decided 2026-04-19).
  "Change of mind" / "change your thinking" in cognitive contexts;
  "repent" in specific-sin contexts. Per-context rule.
- **יְהוָה → Yahweh** throughout the OT and deuterocanon, against
  the traditional "LORD". The divine name is a name. Where the NT
  quotes an OT YHWH passage using Greek Κύριος, the NT verse uses
  "Lord" to preserve the Greek surface — these are quotation
  markers, not theological softening.

Each normalization has a commit history showing the mechanical
change and a documented set of carve-outs.

## Reproducibility verification

`tools/verify.py <verse_id>` takes a published verse and re-runs the
LLM pipeline using the documented inputs. It reports:

- Whether the first draft reproduces (modulo model non-determinism)
- Whether the revision pass reproduces
- Whether the OCR for the cited source page reproduces (for
  scan-grounded verses)

Any third party can run this verification with no access to Cartha
infrastructure — only the public repository, the cited Zone-1
sources from archive.org, and the named LLM APIs.

## Consistency linting

`tools/consistency_lint.py` runs across the entire translation and
flags:

- Same Greek / Hebrew word translated with different English glosses
  without a documented rationale
- Lexical decisions that contradict `DOCTRINE.md`'s default
  renderings without explicit override
- Missing source-text citations
- Empty or malformed verse records
- YAML schema violations against `schema/verse.schema.json`

Lint failures block merge to main. The lint output is also
consumed by the revision Layer-2 batching — same-lemma-different-gloss
clusters become revision targets.

## Public disagreement workflow

Any reader — scholar, pastor, or lay — can file an issue against a
specific verse using templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

- `verse_concern.md` — general concern about a rendering
- `lexical_disagreement.md` — disagreement with a specific word
  choice
- `theological_disagreement.md` — disagreement with a contested-
  reading resolution

The reader's "Suggest Revision" form on cartha.com prefills these
templates from the verse YAML so the issue is self-contained.

If one of those proposals is approved and committed, it can carry
public `credit` metadata in the verse's `revisions:` block. Maintainer
proposals are also marked through their adjudicator metadata. Together,
those accepted proposals are what the public homepage counts as
approved revisions; they are intentionally kept distinct from the
larger machine-assisted applied-edit total.

The project commits to responding publicly to every substantive
issue. Resolution may result in:

- No change, with rationale posted (and linked from the verse YAML)
- A revised rendering, committed with full provenance update
- Elevation of an alternative to main text with the original
  preserved in footnote (or vice versa)

All outcomes are documented publicly. Nothing happens in private
email.
