# Samuel source comparison - pass 3

Checked: 2026-09-04; grammatical counter-control added 2026-09-06.
Target: 1 Samuel 1:24, in its 1:22-25 context.

October 15 follow-up: the [exact research proposal](SAMUEL_1_24_EXACT_SOURCE_PROPOSAL_2026-10-15.md)
adds direct UBS interim-committee consultation and a fully specified short
age-phrase candidate. It separates animal, bread and narrative decisions;
canonical wording and the unresolved source-priority/image/apparatus gates
remain unchanged. The historical assessment below is not a new approval.

## Assessment

The age-related alternative deserves more weight than the previous POB
rationale allowed. My provisional preference is “a three-year-old bull,” with
moderate confidence in historical priority, not a final source selection.
Its support is not merely an interpretation of the Masoretic words: a published
early Hebrew transcription preserves the distinctive age-related word, and the
pinned Greek control explicitly describes one three-year-old animal.

This pass does not yet establish the complete source phrase to publish. The
animal expression belongs to a larger set of differences, including bread and
the surrounding sacrifice narrative. The machine-readable comparison remains
`not-adjudicated`; no canonical source/English selection bundle is promoted.

## What was compared

| Evidence layer | Exact decisive material | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Local WLC, 1:24 | `בְּ/פָרִ֤ים שְׁלֹשָׁה֙` | Three bulls; no bread item in this verse |
| 4Q51, fragments 2a-d, line 7 | `[בפר בן ]בקר משלש ולחם` | The age-related word and bread survive in the published transcription; the preceding words are supplied |
| Pinned Rahlfs Greek, 1:24 | `ἐν μόσχῳ τριετίζοντι καὶ ἄρτοις` | A three-year-old bull and bread; Greek edition control, not direct Hebrew |
| Local WLC, 1:25 | `הַ/פָּ֑ר` | Singular “the bull”; relevant context, not another manuscript vote |

The [versioned Qumran-Digital transcription](https://lexicon.qumran-digital.org/transcriptions/4Q51/2025-03-11/index.html)
places the initial animal words inside editorial brackets, while `בקר משלש ולחם`
is outside them. The stored excerpt stops before deleted illegible signs;
those signs are not silently deciphered. Nearby lines also contain supplied
material. At the initial comparison stage our claim was about the published
reading; the image follow-up below records the subsequent limited inspection.
The [IAA manuscript record](https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q51-2?locale=en_US)
was checked as the institutional access point; an exact image-region crosswalk
had not yet been established for this line at that stage.

The Greek verse 25 also has a longer sacrifice narrative than WLC. A local
animal substitution therefore requires a passage-level literary explanation;
agreement on the animal's age does not license importing or excluding every
other difference automatically.

## Competing explanations

**Why favor the age-related form provisionally?** The preserved Hebrew word
provides evidence beyond Greek back-translation. The Greek control makes its
age sense explicit, and one animal fits the following singular reference
naturally. Their agreement is significant, but it may reflect related textual
transmission, not two wholly independent Hebrew witnesses.

**Why not call the Masoretic form impossible?** Noun-before-numeral order is
attested elsewhere: local WLC 1 Samuel 25:2 has sheep followed by “three
thousand,” alongside the reverse order for “a thousand goats.” A singular animal in the next
verse could single out one animal from a larger offering; a collective
interpretation has also been proposed. These possibilities require argument,
but the singular alone cannot decide the case. The extra flour has been used
to support multiple animals, though Numbers 15:9's three-tenths per bull would
give nine-tenths for three, not exactly one ephah. The amount is a contextual
clue, not a numerical proof or another witness.

[Claude Mariottini's discussion](https://claudemariottini.com/2011/02/21/hannah-and-her-sacrifice/)
endorses the three-bull alternative and reports Robert Ratner's grammatical and
collective-noun arguments. Ratner's original article, *Three Bulls or One? A
Reappraisal of 1 Samuel 1,24*, Biblica 68 (1987), 98-102, was located through
the [publisher record](https://doi.org/10.2143/BIB.68.1.3217901), but full access
requires a subscription or purchase. No purchase was made, and no full reading
of Ratner is claimed. The reported argument remains a lead requiring original
consultation, not a substitute for it.

[Herculaas van Rooy's 2020 research article](https://hts.org.za/index.php/hts/rt/printerFriendly/6137/16202)
documents acceptance of the age reading, competing retention of MT, and
reported Syriac support. The relevant section was read. At that stage the
Peshitta itself and the BHS apparatus remained consultation targets. The
versional follow-up below now adds an edition-derived Syriac comparison;
it does not claim access to the full Leiden or BHS apparatus.

**The copying mechanism must be explicit.** A common explanation appeals to
word division. But removing points and spaces from the extant WLC phrase gives
`בפריםשלשה`, whereas a proposed short phrase `בפר משלש` gives `בפרמשלש`.
These are not identical strings with different spaces: yod and final he also
differ. The published 4Q51 reconstruction additionally includes the herd
expression. A word-division scenario may involve earlier spelling and later
grammatical adjustment; it is a hypothesis, not a demonstrated one-step
operation on the current WLC. No ancient scriptio-continua premise is assumed.

Giving early physical attestation its modest preference strengthens the
provisional age reading. Removing that preference would still leave the
Hebrew/Greek agreement and contextual fit, but would not remove the objections
or justify a high-confidence priority claim. Published attestation, semantic
interpretation, and historical priority are separate assessments.

## Reader and metadata repairs actually applied

- Moved the variant marker from “weaned him” to “three bulls.”
- Named the Hebrew and Greek evidence and disclosed the bread addition.
- Removed the unsupported claim that the age reading likely arose by
  harmonization with verse 25.
- Aligned stale lexical metadata with the existing “with three bulls” and
  “house of Yahweh” wording; the divine-name policy itself was not changed.
- Corrected verse 25's rationale, which mistakenly described the current
  preceding POB verse as already saying “a three-year-old bull.”

No Hebrew source or plain English main-text wording changed in either verse.
Historical model reviews and revision events remain historical; they do not
certify this pass. No generated image or fresh restoration was used.

## Reproduce and finish the case

The [comparison](../sources/textual_restoration/comparisons/samuel_controls.v1.json)
pins verse 24's current file hash and the full Greek control. The
[coverage record](../sources/textual_restoration/coverage/samuel_pilot.v1.json)
distinguishes published-text collation from pending image verification.

Before promotion: complete the image checks described below;
consult the original counterarguments and Greek/Syriac apparatuses; assess
animal, bread, and narrative differences separately within a declared literary
form; record an exact critical-Hebrew phrase with its supplied-word status;
then review the corresponding English in paragraph context. A generated
restoration cannot close any of these evidence gates.

## Image and edition follow-up — 2026-09-04

The primary edition, DJD XVII, printed pages 31–35 (PDF pages 54–58), was
visually consulted through a [third-party-hosted scan](https://messianicessenes.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/djd-17.pdf),
not an official publisher download. Its column II, fragment a, line 7 is the
target. Page 32 connects fragments a, c–d to PAM 43.122 and museum inventories
998/1107. The transcription distinguishes surviving words from reconstruction;
the discussion proposes an erased duplication after bread, which this project
does not adopt as a fresh reading. Page 35's longer reconstruction of verses
24–25 remains editorial and does not settle the original narrative form.

That locator resolves to [IAA B-277400 / PAM M43.122](https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/image/B-277400?locale=en_US),
an August 1959 scanned infrared negative. A single-editor, context-informed
inspection matched the upper-right column to preceding lines in 1:22–24.
The offering line spans viewer tiles `x2-y1-z3` and `x3-y1-z3`. Its visible
forms are consistent with the published age-related word `משלש` and bread
`ולחם`. This is a partial corroborative check after reading the transcription,
not blind decipherment, an independent witness, or recovery of lost words.
Exact glyph coordinates were not measured; erased traces remain unresolved.

A routing problem matters here: the [UiA plate inventory](https://lyingpen.uia.no/dssinventoryproject/fascicle7/)
associates plate 1099 with 1 Samuel 1–3, but the inspected IAA fragment 2
(B-368628) instead showed material in 2 Samuel 2–3. That candidate was excluded
for this target; a broad plate-range label must not substitute for matching
the actual text. The edition's PAM number supplied the successful route.
A modern plate-998 color candidate (B-499052) failed to render; its exact
assignment to the target was not established.

Twenty original viewer tiles were retained as a private consultation copy
outside the repository. The coverage receipt identifies the two target tiles
by observed URL, private-copy key, filename, dimensions and SHA256. No tiles
were stitched, enhanced, generated, or vendored. The
[IAA terms](https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/terms) were checked for private
consultation; this receipt grants no publication or redistribution rights.
The edition PDF is also private, SHA256
`6866ffbfa230c44dc439dfaef8f229cd41219acfe31d6d9478d4e6002a70604d`.

Still open: full-resolution/master and usable modern-image comparison,
letter-level review of uncertain features, original counterarguments,
Greek/Syriac apparatuses, and a justified complete Hebrew/English selection.
The image gate remains open. No source or English main-text change follows
from this inspection.

## Greek apparatus and Syriac follow-up — 2026-09-04

### What was actually consulted

[Brooke, McLean and Thackeray, *The Old Testament in Greek*, II.1 (1927)](https://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/Brooke%26McLean/LXX_Brooke%26McLean_2-1.pdf),
printed page 4 (PDF 20), was visually checked together with preface v–viii
(PDF 11–14). Its Vaticanus-based text has the age-related bull, bread, and
longer narrative. The separate bottom apparatus gives `μετὰ ταύρων τριῶν`
(with three bulls), attributed to Symmachus in `z`. The Samuel preface maps
`z` to Rahlfs 554, Paris BnF grec 133. This is a reported marginal attribution,
not that codex's continuous Septuagint text. No direct inspection of grec 133
is claimed. The Greek alternatives must not be called unanimous.

The [1906 Genesis preface](https://tmcdaniel.palmerseminary.edu/Brooke%26McLean/LXX_Brooke%26McLean_1-1.pdf),
printed i–ii, iv–v and viii (PDF 9–10, 12–13, 16), supplies the edition's
general rules and identifies `σ′` as Symmachus. It distinguishes the base
manuscript, variant apparatus, and marginal Hexaplaric material. Its cursive
sigla cannot simply be carried into Samuel: use the Samuel volume's mapping.
The Samuel preface also distinguishes Jacob of Edessa's Greek-influenced
revision from the Peshitta; its Syriac apparatus evidence is not automatically
an independent Peshitta witness.

The [CAL chapter text](https://cal.huc.edu/get_a_chapter.php?cset=S&file=62008&sub=01)
was consulted at 1:24–25. Its
[source information](https://cal.huc.edu/get_file_info.php?coord=62008&return=/ot_peshitta.html)
identifies a Leiden-derived text with some corrections based on manuscript
7a1. The animal is singular, followed by `ܬܘܠܬܐ`; flour follows directly,
without bread, and verse 25 has the short slaughter-and-presentation sequence.
The [CAL lexical entry](https://cal.huc.edu/oneentry.php?cits=all&lemma=twlt+N)
places this passage under the animal-age sense, but also warns that the term
is not straightforwardly explicit exegesis. Record the conventional
three-year-old interpretation without treating it as a secure reconstruction
of particular Hebrew letters. We did not consult the complete Leiden apparatus
or identify the age reading separately in every Syriac manuscript.

### What this changes in the decision

| Evidence as checked | Animal | Bread | Sacrifice narrative |
|---|---|---|---|
| WLC | Three bulls | Absent | Short |
| 4Q51 published text | Age-related word preserved; preceding wording supplied | Preserved | Full reconstruction remains disputed |
| Greek Rahlfs / Cambridge base | Three-year-old bull | Present | Longer |
| CAL Peshitta control | Age-related singular bull | Absent | Short |
| Symmachus marginal attribution | Three bulls | Not assessed from this note | Not assessed from this note |

The Syriac combination gives an ancient-version parallel for an age-related
animal within a shorter narrative without bread. Therefore an age-only change
is not automatically an unprecedented combination; its exact Hebrew form and
historical priority still require argument. Conversely, the Syriac cannot
support importing bread or the longer Greek narrative. Symmachus supplies an
opposing versional attestation for three bulls, not proof that MT is original.
Neither discovery closes the case by counting votes.

The provisional animal preference remains moderate, not high confidence.
Next adjudicate three linked questions explicitly: animal expression, bread,
and narrative form. Test possible Syriac dependence on Greek rather than
assuming a third independent Hebrew base. Retain the strongest MT arguments
and the missing original Ratner consultation. No Hebrew or English main-text
change was applied in this follow-up.

### Reproducibility and access limits

Both edition PDFs remain private consultation copies outside the repo:

- Samuel SHA256: `327bd0dcb8135ddc2d11cf109c77abcbe60e337e1ee017c69c6bd14a37061756`.

CAL was read through the web retrieval results. Separate direct HTTP requests
returned identical home-page content, not the requested chapter or lexical
records. Those responses were rejected as evidence snapshots. The dated URLs
and brief excerpts document consultation, not a frozen full CAL corpus. The
initial peshitta.eu lead is not counted as another witness or as the provenance
authority; the recorded comparison uses CAL's explicit source attribution.

## Grammatical counter-control and bounded decision — 2026-09-06

**Result: retain the current source and English provisionally, with the existing
variant note.** The age-related alternative remains a reasonable research
preference, not an approved complete Hebrew reading. This pass strengthens a
previously reported objection with a directly checked grammatical example;
it neither overturns the published 4Q51 evidence nor establishes MT priority.

Ben Zvi, Hancock and Beinert, *Readings in Biblical Hebrew* (Yale, 1993),
[publisher excerpt](https://drupal.yalebooks.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Media/9780300055733_Zvi_Readings%20in%20Biblical%20Hebrew/9780300055733_Excerpt.pdf),
printed p. 37 (PDF page 36), discusses collective reference by a definite
singular after a plural and applies that possibility to the bull in verse 25.
The complete printed page and preceding page were visually inspected. This is
the textbook's argument, including its citation of Ratner, not consultation of
Ratner's original article. His [publisher access page](https://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?download=yes&id=3217901&journal_code=BIB&url=article.php)
still required subscription or purchase; neither was attempted.

The cited Numbers 21:6–7 control was checked in local WLC source fields:
`הנחשים` in verse 6 is followed by `הנחש` in verse 7 in the request to remove
the snakes. This verifies a relevant plural-to-singular construction, not a
manuscript variant. Genesis 15:9–10 separately supplies two bird terms followed
by singular `הצפר`; it is a related semantic control, not the identical noun
sequence. Local inputs were inspected at repository revision
`2c95c143228ea125815ceddfecbc366428cf76ec`.

**Our inference:** singular `הפר` in 1 Samuel 1:25 cannot alone demonstrate that
“three bulls” in verse 24 is corrupt. Collective reference is possible, while
a single animal selected from several is another live explanation. Neither is
proved for Samuel by the Numbers parallel. Do not translate verse 25 as “the
bulls” automatically, or reuse its current singular English as independent
evidence for emending verse 24.

The three decisions therefore remain distinct:

- **Animal:** published early Hebrew and Greek support still favor investigating
  the age reading; the singular-context argument is non-decisive. A proposed
  `בפר משלש` is not the complete surviving phrase of 4Q51, whose edition supplies
  preceding words. No exact replacement source phrase is approved.
- **Bread:** support already recorded in Hebrew/Greek does not itself resolve
  omission versus expansion. Retain the current shorter text provisionally;
  do not infer rejection of bread from the animal decision.
- **Narrative:** the shorter Peshitta control shows that animal age and narrative
  length can vary separately, but does not establish independent Hebrew ancestry
  or authorize an eclectic Hebrew reconstruction.

Close this bounded grammatical check as **no canonical change**. Reopen source
selection with an explicit full Hebrew candidate, declared narrative form and
a transmission argument addressing the recorded objections, together with the
existing image/apparatus gates above. Repeated checks of the same singular or
another general photograph search would not resolve those requirements.
