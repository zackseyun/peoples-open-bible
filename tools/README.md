# Tools

Python scripts for drafting, cross-checking, validating, and linting the
People's Open Bible.

## Scripts

| Script | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sblgnt.py` | implemented | Parses the MorphGNT SBLGNT text files; exposes `load_verse(book, chapter, verse)` and `morphology_lines(verse)`. |
| `wlc.py` | implemented | Parses the Westminster Leningrad Codex / unfoldingWord Hebrew Bible for OT verses. |
| `build_translation_prompt.py` | implemented | Builds the Phase 9 deuterocanon prompt block from the adjudicated Swete corpus, Hebrew/MT parallels, Zone 2 consult registry, and doctrine/philosophy excerpts. Supports `--json` for prompt + metadata inspection. |
| `draft.py` | implemented | Produces an AI-drafted verse YAML for a single verse. Reads source text, extracts relevant DOCTRINE.md sections, calls a frontier LLM with a tool definition enforcing structured output, writes a schema-valid YAML to `translation/<testament>/<book>/<chapter>/<verse>.yaml`. Supports `--dry-run` for prompt inspection without an API call, and now supports deuterocanonical books through the dedicated prompt builder. |
| `cross_check.py` | stub | Runs draft against Claude + GPT + Gemini in parallel, scores agreement, surfaces divergences. Spec in METHODOLOGY.md Stage 3. |
| `consistency_lint.py` | implemented | Checks internal consistency across drafted YAMLs. Flags undocumented lexical variance, contested-term doctrine gaps/overrides, and empty source text; writes Markdown reports to `lint_reports/`. |
| `run_phase.py` | implemented | Drives a full phase (e.g., Phase 0 = Philippians) end to end: drafting, linting, commits, and CHANGELOG updates. |
| `chapter_queue.py` | implemented | Maintains a SQLite-backed chapter queue/ledger for whole-Bible drafting. |
| `chapter_worker.py` | implemented | Claims chapter jobs from the queue, drafts them in a worker worktree, and commits chapter-sized results. |
| `chapter_merge.py` | implemented | Cherry-picks completed worker chapter commits onto `main` in canonical order and records merge state. |
| `dashboard_server.py` | implemented | Serves a local live dashboard showing active queue workers, claimed chapters, progress percentages, ready-to-merge jobs, and recent commits. |
| `validate_reader_corpus.py` | implemented | Pre-publish reader guardrail: validates corpus YAML, blocks synthetic chapter-as-verse-1 mirrors from coexisting with real per-verse files, and catches verse 1 containing later verse text. |
| `check_derived_coverage.py` | implemented | Fails when any canonical POB verse is missing from SPOB, Spanish POB, or Korean POB, preventing late-added base verses from silently skipping derived backfill. |
| `simplified_pob_pipeline.py` | implemented | Drafts the Simplified People's Open Bible (SPOB) as a plain-language English derivative of POB under `translation_simplified/`, preserving POB reasoning layers as audit guardrails. |
| `transcribe_source.py` | implemented | Transcribes Swete Greek and Schechter Hebrew source pages from archival scans via GPT-5.4 vision, writing UTF-8 text plus provenance sidecars. |
| `review_transcription.py` | implemented | Reviews an existing Swete transcription against the scan image via GPT-5.4, returning structured corrections-only function output and per-page review metadata. |
| `summarize_transcription_reviews.py` | implemented | Aggregates GPT-5.4 and Claude review outputs, reports parseability, correction counts, and high-risk pages for adjudication. |
| `review_phase8_swete.sh` | implemented | Convenience launcher for the full 572-page Phase 8 Swete GPT-5.4 review run, with resumable `--skip-existing` behavior and per-volume logs. |
| `build_normalized_deuterocanon_corpus.py` | implemented | Builds translation-ready override files for deuterocanonical books whose raw adjudicated stream still contains known numbering contamination. The translation layer prefers these normalized overrides when present. |
| `build_esther_additions_corpus.py` | implemented | Emits the standalone ESG (Additions to Esther) normalized corpus from the Swete pages, using First1KGreek only as a verse-boundary anchor map where needed. |
| `fetch_psalm_151_hebrew.py` | implemented | Stages a local-only Psalm 151 Hebrew consult cache from Sefaria's API at `~/cartha-reference-local/psalm151_hebrew/`, so the prompt builder can surface the 11QPsᵃ counterpart without vendoring restricted source material. |

**Deuterocanon drafting contract:** use the standalone units `ESG`,
`PAZ`, `SUS`, and `BEL` for Phase 9 drafting. The older aggregate
stream labels `ADE` and `ADA` remain in the repo for source/audit
purposes, but are intentionally blocked in the drafting path.

## Prerequisites

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

Required environment variables:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...    # for Claude drafts / cross-check
OPENAI_API_KEY=...       # for GPT drafts / cross-check
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...   # for OpenRouter GPT drafts
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=... # for GPT-5.4 drafts
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...  # for GPT-5.4 drafts
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID=... # optional, defaults to gpt-5-4-deployment
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...       # for Gemini cross-check
```

## Quick start — draft one verse

```bash
# Dry run: inspect the prompt that would be sent, without an API call.
python3 tools/draft.py --ref "Philippians 1:1" --dry-run

# Real run via OpenRouter GPT-5.4:
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
python3 tools/draft.py --ref "Philippians 1:1" --backend openrouter-sdk --model openai/gpt-5.4

# Real run via GPT-5.4:
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=...
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID=gpt-5-4-deployment
python3 tools/draft.py --ref "Philippians 1:1" --backend azure-openai --model gpt-5.4

# Deuterocanon prompt dry run:
python3 tools/build_translation_prompt.py --book 1MA --chapter 1 --verse 1 --json
python3 tools/draft.py --book SIR --chapter 1 --verse 1 --dry-run
```


# Local worker dashboard:
python3 tools/dashboard_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765

Model, temperature, and prompt ID are configurable via CLI flags or
environment variables (`CARTHA_MODEL_ID`, `CARTHA_TEMPERATURE`,
`CARTHA_PROMPT_ID`).

| `shepherd_of_hermas.py` | implemented | Parses the raw Lightfoot 1891 Hermas OCR into stable normalized units such as `V.3.xiii`, `M.4.ii`, and `S.5.vi`, and can write normalized text files plus `sources/shepherd_of_hermas/transcribed/unit_map.json` for future drafter work. |
| `build_shepherd_of_hermas_prompt.py` | implemented | Builds a draft-ready translation prompt for one normalized Hermas unit (for example `V.3.i`, `M.4.ii`, or `S.8.ii`) with source metadata, project excerpts, and source-integrity warnings. |
