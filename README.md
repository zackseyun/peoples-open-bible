# the People's Open Bible

Managed by [cartha.com](https://cartha.com).

This is the people’s Bible — the most accurate-to-original translation
from Hebrew, Greek, and Latin into English that we can build. Every
decision is publicly defensible and publicly revisable. Our data,
methods, and code are published as openly as possible.

## What makes this different

### From manuscript originals

- **Direct from the originals.** Drafted from original Hebrew, Greek,
  and Latin source texts — including books where we used AI vision
  models to read the text directly from manuscript photographs. See the
  [source corpora](sources/README.md).
- **Every translation decision is publicly documented.** Every verse is
  a file in this repository with the source text, the English rendering,
  every lexical decision (source word, chosen gloss, alternatives
  considered, lexicon entry, rationale), and contested theological
  readings with alternatives preserved. Every change is traceable in
  git, and every disagreement can have a permanent URL. See
  [John 1:1’s source record](translation/nt/john/001/001.yaml).
- **Every verse is reproducible.** Given the source text, prompt hash,
  and model identifier, any third party can re-run the pipeline and
  verify the documented draft. No other English Bible in history has
  offered this level of public reproducibility. Read the
  [methodology](METHODOLOGY.md).

## Why we built this

### A method, not a claim of authority

We’re not claiming authority. We’re presenting a method: use
state-of-the-art AI alongside original Hebrew, Greek, and Latin source
texts to render a translation as close to what the original scribes
wrote as we can get. Everything that goes into it is open-sourced —
source texts, restored public-domain manuscript material, model passes,
lexical decisions, revisions, and disagreements.

The point is not that the first draft is perfect. The point is that the
whole process is inspectable, repeatable, and publicly revisable. If a
reader disagrees with a rendering, they can see why it was chosen,
inspect the alternatives, and propose a better one.

See [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md) for the full statement on openness,
transparency, and our theological commitments.

## Use it freely

## How POB reads — compared to NKJV and NIV

Two verses that illustrate what POB does differently, and why.

### Ecclesiastes 1:2

| | Rendering |
|---|---|
| **POB** | "**Breath of breaths**, says **Qoheleth**; breath of breaths, all is **mere breath**." |
| NKJV | "**Vanity of vanities**, says the Preacher; Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." |
| NIV | "**Meaningless! Meaningless!** says the Teacher. Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless." |

- **The key word, *hevel* (`הֶבֶל`) — "breath" / "mere breath."** Not simply "vanity" or "meaninglessness." The Hebrew image is concrete: breath, vapor, something real but fleeting, ungraspable, and gone almost as soon as it appears.
- **Why not "vanity"?** It is historically familiar, but modern readers often hear pride or self-obsession, which is not Qoheleth's point.
- **Why not "meaninglessness"?** It over-decides the theology and pushes the verse toward nihilism. *Hevel* is broader: transient, elusive, ironic, and frustrating.
- **The speaker, *Qoheleth* (`קֹהֶלֶת`) — "Qoheleth."** This preserves the Hebrew title/name instead of narrowing it immediately to "Preacher" or "Teacher."

### Genesis 6:6

| | Rendering |
|---|---|
| **POB** | "And **Yahweh grieved over** having made man on the earth, and he was **pained in his heart**." |
| NKJV | "And the LORD was **sorry** that He had made man on the earth, and He was **grieved in His heart**." |
| NIV | "The LORD **regretted** that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was **deeply troubled**." |

- **The first verb (`וַיִּנָּחֶם`) — "grieved over."** This preserves divine sorrow without making the English sound like God made a mistaken choice or lacked foresight. "Regretted" can imply that in modern English; "repented" would imply moral fault; "was sorry" is possible but softer.
- **The second verb (`וַיִּתְעַצֵּב`) — "was pained."** This carries the inward wound-like force of the Hebrew. POB avoids flattening both verbs into one general grief word.
- **The divine name (`יהוה`) — "Yahweh."** This makes the name visible rather than hiding it behind the typographic substitute "LORD."

### The philosophy behind these choices

POB's choice is **source-image accuracy in the main text + contextual understanding in a companion layer** — not traditional smoothing, theological over-resolution, or pastoral softening of the translation itself.

Ecclesiastes 1:2 shows why this matters: *hevel* is not just "vanity" and not simply "meaninglessness." It is breath — real, visible for a moment, impossible to hold. Genesis 6:6 shows the same principle with theology: the text really portrays Yahweh as grieving and inwardly pained, but the English should not accidentally imply that God was surprised, morally wrong, or wishing he could undo an uninformed mistake.

In both cases, familiar renderings preserve something valuable, but they also make hidden choices for the reader. POB keeps the core source-language pressure in the sentence itself, then uses footnotes, YAML rationale, the in-app **Original context** AI tool, and public discussion to make every choice visible and defensible.

## License

The translation is released under **CC-BY 4.0** — the canonical open-content
license. You may use, adapt, redistribute, or commercialize this work with
attribution. **Anyone may fork it, translate it into other languages,
include it in commercial products, or build derivatives without permission.**
We never paywall scripture. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [PHILOSOPHY.md](PHILOSOPHY.md).

Source texts retain their original licenses (see [sources/README.md](sources/README.md)).

## Doctrinal stance

Translation decisions follow the commitments in [DOCTRINE.md](DOCTRINE.md).
Declaring our stance up front is a form of honesty — critics can assess our
output against our stated commitments rather than guessing at hidden biases.

## Methodology

See [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) for the drafting pipeline, cross-check
protocol, and reproducibility verification. For the deuterocanonical
source-text rescue work specifically — how the Swete corpus was improved,
rescued, and confidence-promoted from direct scan inspection — see
[docs/PHASE8_CORPUS_QUALITY_RESCUE.md](docs/PHASE8_CORPUS_QUALITY_RESCUE.md).

## The Deuterocanonical Books (Apocrypha)

The People's Open Bible includes the Deuterocanonical books — Tobit, Judith,
Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), Baruch, 1–4 Maccabees, and
others — as a clearly labeled section. See [DEUTEROCANONICAL.md](DEUTEROCANONICAL.md)
for the full strategy; in brief:

### Why we include them

These books are canonical in the **Roman Catholic** (Trent, 1546),
**Eastern Orthodox** (Synod of Jerusalem, 1672), and **Oriental Orthodox**
traditions, and were included in **Luther's 1534 German Bible** and the
**original 1611 King James Version** as a middle section between the
Testaments. Their removal from most modern Protestant Bibles is a
19th-century development driven primarily by printing economics at the
British and Foreign Bible Society — not theological consensus.

Excluding them would be making a theological editorial decision *before*
the reader ever sees the text. That is the opposite of what the Cartha
Open Bible exists to do. Our mission is transparency and auditability —
present the textual tradition; let the reader and their faith community
judge what they affirm as canonical.

**We take no position on canonicity.** Including these books is not an
assertion that they carry the same authority as the Protestant canon.
Excluding them would be an assertion that they do not. We translate and
publish; the reader decides.

### How we honor them

These books receive the **same rigor as the Protestant canon** — same
drafter/reviser pipeline, same per-verse YAML with full provenance,
same license (CC-BY 4.0). No corner-cutting because they are "deutero."

Each book is translated from **the most-original extant text we can
lawfully access**:

- For books composed in Greek (Wisdom of Solomon, 2 Maccabees, the
  additions to Esther and Daniel), the LXX *is* the original — there
  is nothing behind it. Source: Swete's public-domain 1909–1930
  Septuagint.
- For books where the Hebrew or Aramaic original is lost (1 Maccabees,
  Judith, Baruch, 1 Esdras), the LXX is the oldest surviving witness.
  Same source.
- For **Sirach**, we translate primarily from the Hebrew where it
  survives — from Schechter & Taylor's public-domain 1899 edition
  of Cairo Genizah MSS A and B, and from fresh AI-vision
  transcriptions of the other manuscripts from public-domain
  photographs.
- For **Tobit**, we translate from the LXX Greek (Long Recension,
  supported by Codex Sinaiticus) and plan to incorporate the Qumran
  Aramaic fragments as a primary source for the ~20% of verses they
  cover, pending a licensing request to the Israel Antiquities
  Authority.

### How they are labeled

In both the repository and the mobile app:

- A clear section header: **"Deuterocanonical Books (Apocrypha)"**
- An introductory note explaining the canonical-status landscape across
  traditions.
- Each book's header shows its canonical status at a glance:
  *"Canonical in: Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox. Considered useful
  but not canonical in: most Protestant traditions."*
- Internal references (cross-references, reading plans, search results)
  treat these books as first-class citizens while preserving the label.

The reader should never be confused about what they are reading or which
traditions receive it as Scripture.

### The scholarship-integrity commitment

We consult the leading scholarly editions actively during our work —
Beentjes 1997 for Hebrew Sirach, Fitzmyer 1995 for Qumran Tobit,
Skehan & Di Lella 1987, the Göttingen critical LXX editions, and
further scholarship as needed. That consultation is how modern
translation has always been done: read everything, weigh every
variant, produce fresh work. Copyright law governs **reproduction**,
not reading — and consultation of scholarship to inform our own
fresh translation is standard, uncontroversial scholarly practice.

What we **do not** do is vendor or reproduce copyrighted scholarly
transcriptions (Beentjes's specific Hebrew text, the DJD volumes'
Qumran transcriptions, Rahlfs digital editions under restrictive
licenses, etc.). Every source text in this repository is either
public-domain by age or freshly produced by us from public-domain
photographs under CC-BY 4.0.

Where established scholarship informs a translation decision, we
cite it in footnotes — fact-level citation, not reproduction of
creative expression, uncontroversial under US copyright law
(*Feist v. Rural*, 1991). This combination — fresh transcription +
active consultation of the scholarly literature + transparent
citation — is exactly how the NRSV, NABRE, and Orthodox Study
Bible produce their Apocrypha sections. It's how serious
translation actually works.

### What we bring to this corner of the canon

English translations of the Apocrypha already exist — NRSV, NABRE,
Orthodox Study Bible, NETS, the Lexham English Septuagint. Each was
produced by a specialist committee with years of scholarly work.
We are not trying to replace them. We are contributing something
adjacent that has not existed before:

- **The first freely-redistributable deuterocanonical translation
  from a scan-grounded corpus.** Brenton's 1851 LXX translation is
  public-domain but 175 years old; every scholarly translation since
  is under a restrictive license. The People's Open Bible Apocrypha
  is released under **CC-BY 4.0** — use it, quote it, remix it,
  ship it in your app. This is a substantive contribution on its own.

- **A translation grounded in Swete's diplomatic Codex Vaticanus.**
  NETS uses Rahlfs-Hanhart (eclectic). NRSV and NABRE use the
  Göttingen critical editions (also eclectic). No current English
  translation takes **Swete's diplomatic Vaticanus** as its primary
  source. For readers who want "what Codex Vaticanus actually prints"
  rather than "what modern editors reconstruct," this fills a real
  gap — and we are transparent that this is the choice we made and
  why.

- **Per-verse provenance, publicly auditable.** Every verse traces
  back to the specific scan pages it was drawn from, which independent
  transcriptions agreed or disagreed, which Hebrew or Aramaic parallels
  were consulted, which scholarly references informed the judgment,
  and at what confidence level the source-text reading was adjudicated.
  This level of auditability per verse is, to our knowledge,
  unprecedented for an English Bible translation. You don't have to
  trust our committee; you can read the receipts.

- **Multi-witness triangulation at scale.** For every deuterocanonical
  verse we cross-checked four independent Greek transcriptions
  (our own OCR, First1KGreek TEI, Rahlfs, and Amicarelli) against the
  actual scanned page image — and where Hebrew witnesses survive, we
  add them as additional evidence (Cairo Geniza Hebrew Sirach, the
  Masada scroll, Neubauer Tobit, the WLC Hebrew for 1 Esdras
  parallels). This kind of systematic multi-source grounding, applied
  per verse with a documented rubric, is harder for human committees
  to do at scale.

From the engineering and textual-criticism side, this will be the most
transparent, the most auditable, the most permissively-licensed, and
(for Sirach specifically) among the most Hebrew-grounded Apocrypha
translations available in English today. That's the contribution,
stated plainly.

For the full scholarly-source policy (three-zone model: vendored /
consulted / forbidden), see [REFERENCE_SOURCES.md](REFERENCE_SOURCES.md).

### Why this honors the texts

These books are read as Scripture by **hundreds of millions of
Christians**, and have been for two millennia. They shaped the
vocabulary of the New Testament — James echoes Sirach; Hebrews 11
lists Maccabean martyrs alongside the patriarchs; the Magnificat
echoes Judith's prayer. They were the devotional library of Jesus's
own world.

Translating them carefully, with provenance and honest footnotes,
under a free license, using the best tools we have — this honors them
as Scripture for those who receive them as Scripture, and as early
Jewish religious literature for those who do not. It refuses the
shortcut of deciding for the reader what counts.

That refusal is the whole point of the People's Open Bible.

## Extra-canonical scripture

Beyond the 13 LXX-based deuterocanonical books (Phase 8), the Cartha
Open Bible is committed to translating a further corpus of
extra-canonical texts under CC-BY 4.0. See
[EXTRA_CANONICAL.md](EXTRA_CANONICAL.md) for the complete scope
document.

The rationale is the same as for the deuterocanon, extended:

- **Some of these texts are canonical in other Christian traditions.**
  1 Enoch and Jubilees are received as Scripture by the Ethiopian
  and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches. A Bible that silently
  excludes them is a Bible shaped by Western publishing history,
  not by the historical breadth of Christian reception.
- **Some are quoted explicitly in the New Testament.** Jude 14-15
  quotes 1 Enoch 1:9 directly.
- **Some shaped how the New Testament canon formed.** The Didache,
  1 Clement, and the Shepherd of Hermas were included in early NT
  codices (Sinaiticus includes Hermas; Alexandrinus includes 1
  Clement). Understanding canon formation requires access to the
  works that were weighed alongside the canonical ones.
- **Every existing modern English translation is under restrictive
  copyright.** No current open-license, modern-register translation
  of 1 Enoch, 2 Esdras, 2 Baruch, or the Didache exists.

### Scope

Three tiers, by reception status rather than by scholarly quality.
Every text ships with explicit canonical-status labeling across
traditions, and for the third tier, with explicit framing of its
date, manuscript provenance, and theological-literary character.

**Tier 1 — extra-canonical with historical canonical status somewhere:**
2 Esdras (KJV Apocrypha; Vulgate appendix), 1 Enoch (Ethiopian
Orthodox canonical), Jubilees (Ethiopian Orthodox canonical),
Psalms of Solomon (in some early LXX manuscripts).

**Tier 2 — Apostolic Fathers and pseudepigrapha:** Didache, 1 Clement,
Shepherd of Hermas, 2 Baruch, Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.

**Tier 3 — early Christian mystical and contemplative texts (Nag
Hammadi, with framing):** Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Truth,
Thunder Perfect Mind. We include these three because none of them
articulates a cosmologically disruptive Gnostic framework: Thomas
is a sayings collection, Truth is Valentinian contemplation without
demiurge cosmology, and Thunder is a paradoxical divine-feminine
monologue that resists categorization. We translate them with
unambiguous framing as 4th-century Christian mystical literature —
not canonical Scripture, but historically important.

### What we are holding out

**Apocryphon of John** and **Gospel of Philip** are not currently in
scope. Both articulate explicit Gnostic cosmological or sacramental
frameworks that we consider too theologically disruptive to include
without further work on responsible framing. We are open to
reconsidering.

### How this gets built

Extra-canonical translation follows Phase 9 (LXX deuterocanon
drafting) in a phased rollout by shared pipeline. 2 Esdras and
2 Baruch now sit in the same **Semitic apocalypse multi-witness**
family (see [2ESDRAS.md](2ESDRAS.md) and [2BARUCH.md](2BARUCH.md)):
2 Esdras is Latin-primary, 2 Baruch is Syriac-primary, but the
architecture is intentionally shared. The
Apostolic Fathers (Didache, 1 Clement, Shepherd of Hermas) reuse our
existing LXX Greek-primary infrastructure. 1 Enoch and Jubilees
require a new Ethiopic (Ge'ez) pipeline. The Nag Hammadi group
requires a new Coptic pipeline plus per-codex license research.

See [EXTRA_CANONICAL.md](EXTRA_CANONICAL.md) for per-text source
editions, phase sequencing, and the per-text license situation.

## Current status

The project is in its initial AI-drafting phase. Every verse in this
repository was produced by a frontier AI model, with full provenance, and
is released as a draft — not as a finalized translation. What you are
reading is exactly what the AI produced, with the rationale for every
decision visible alongside it. The repository is public so the process is
inspectable from the first commit forward.

## Contributing

Found a verse you'd translate differently? Open an issue using one of the
templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. Engagement is welcomed from
scholars, pastors, and lay readers. Our commitment is to respond publicly
to every substantive concern.

## Refreshing cached summaries after major revisions

The live reader caches chapter- and book-level summaries separately from the
translation text itself. Missing summaries are filled automatically by the
existing summary-prewarm workflow, but **forced refreshes are manual on
purpose**. We do **not** automatically regenerate summaries on every push.

When a book has changed substantially, run:

```bash
scripts/refresh_book_summaries.sh "1 ENOCH"
```

Useful flags:

```bash
scripts/refresh_book_summaries.sh "1 ENOCH" --workers 20
scripts/refresh_book_summaries.sh "1 ENOCH" --chapters-only
```

Recommended policy:

- **Definitely run it when a book's second pass is finished.**
- **Usually run it again after a third pass** if major wording or framing changed.
- You can also run it after any other **significant revision batch** for that
  book.
- After the second and third pass, further summary changes should normally be
  small, so routine refreshes beyond that are optional.

## Release cadence

The translation is built and released phase-by-phase, with each phase a full
set of complete books (not partial books):

- Phase 1: Pauline epistles (Romans through Philemon)
- Phase 2: Gospels + Acts
- Phase 3: General epistles + Revelation
- Phase 4: Torah (Genesis through Deuteronomy)
- Phase 5: Former Prophets (Joshua through 2 Kings)
- Phase 6: Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Chronicles, etc.)
- Phase 7: Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Twelve)
- Phase 8: Deuterocanonical books (Tobit through 4 Maccabees, from LXX). Corpus complete as of 2026-04-20 (13 books, 6,337 verses, 98.9% high-confidence scan-adjudicated transcription). Translation drafting begins in Phase 9. See [DEUTEROCANONICAL.md](DEUTEROCANONICAL.md), [REFERENCE_SOURCES.md](REFERENCE_SOURCES.md) (three-zone scholarly-source policy), and [REVISION_LATER.md](REVISION_LATER.md) (deferred-source integration).

Tagged releases follow the `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` convention. The first public
release is `v0.1-preview`.
